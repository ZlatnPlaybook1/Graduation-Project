                      Cyber security careers are becoming more in demand and
                      offer high salaries. There are many different jobs within
                      the security industry, from offensive pentesting (hacking
                      machines and reporting on vulnerabilities) to defensive
                      security (defending against and investigating
                      cyberattacks).

                      Security analysts are integral to constructing security
                      measures across organisations to protect the company from
                      attacks. Analysts explore and evaluate company networks to
                      uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers
                      to develop preventative measures. This job role requires
                      working with various stakeholders to gain an understanding
                      of security requirements and the security landscape.

                      Security engineers develop and implement security
                      solutions using threats and vulnerability data - often
                      sourced from members of the security workforce. Security
                      engineers work across circumventing a breadth of attacks,
                      including web application attacks, network threats, and
                      evolving trends and tactics. The ultimate goal is to
                      retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of
                      attack and data loss.

                      Incident responders respond productively and efficiently
                      to security breaches. Responsibilities include creating
                      plans, policies, and protocols for organisations to enact
                      during and following incidents. This is often a highly
                      pressurised position with assessments and responses
                      required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding. Incident
                      response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR - the
                      meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover (from
                      attacks.) The aim is to achieve a swift and effective
                      response, retain financial standing and avoid negative
                      breach implications. Ultimately, incident responders
                      protect the company's data, reputation, and financial
                      standing from cyber attacks.

                      If you like to play detective, this might be the perfect
                      job. If you are working as part of a law-enforcement
                      department, you would be focused on collecting and
                      analysing evidence to help solve crimes: charging the
                      guilty and exonerating the innocent. On the other hand, if
                      your work falls under defending a company's network, you
                      will be using your forensic skills to analyse incidents,
                      such as policy violations.

                      A malware analyst's work involves analysing suspicious
                      programs, discovering what they do and writing reports
                      about their findings. A malware analyst is sometimes
                      called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves
                      around converting compiled programs from machine language
                      to readable code, usually in a low-level language. This
                      work requires the malware analyst to have a strong
                      programming background, especially in low-level languages
                      such as assembly language and C language. The ultimate
                      goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious
                      program carries out, find out how to detect it and report
                      it.

                      You may see penetration testing referred to as pentesting
                      and ethical hacking. A penetration tester's job role is to
                      test the security of the systems and software within a
                      company - this is achieved through attempts to uncover
                      flaws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking.
                      Penetration testers exploit these vulnerabilities to
                      evaluate the risk in each instance. The company can then
                      take these insights to rectify issues to prevent a
                      real-world cyberattack.

                      Red teamers share similarities to penetration testers,
                      with a more targeted job role. Penetration testers look to
                      uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep
                      cyber-defence in good standing, whilst red teamers are
                      enacted to test the company's detection and response
                      capabilities. This job role requires imitating cyber
                      criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining
                      access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can
                      run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the
                      company. They are often best suited to organisations with
                      mature security programs in place.
