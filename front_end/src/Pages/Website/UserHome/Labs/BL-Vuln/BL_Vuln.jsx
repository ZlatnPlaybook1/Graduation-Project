                web applications, where legitimate processes are manipulated to
                achieve unintended outcomes. These vulnerabilities occur when an
                applicationâ€™s functionality or workflows are misused, bypassing
                intended logic or restrictions to perform unauthorized actions.
                Understanding these vulnerabilities involves identifying flaws
                in business rules, data flows, or decision-making processes, and
                implementing secure validation and authorization mechanisms to
                prevent exploitation."

                    Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and
                    implementation of an application that allow an attacker to
                    elicit unintended behavior. This potentially enables
                    attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve
                    a malicious goal. These flaws are generally the result of
                    failing to anticipate unusual application states that may
                    occur and, consequently, failing to handle them safely.

                      <b>
                        In this context, the term "business logic" simply
                        refers to the set of rules that define how the
                        application operates. As these rules aren't always
                        directly related to a business, the associated
                        vulnerabilities are also known as "application logic
                        vulnerabilities" or simply "logic flaws".

                    </i>

                  <p className="desc">
                    Logic flaws are often invisible to people who aren't
                    explicitly looking for them as they typically won't be
                    exposed by normal use of the application. However, an
                    attacker may be able to exploit behavioral quirks by
                    interacting with the application in ways that developers
                    never intended. One of the main purposes of business logic
                    is to enforce the rules and constraints that were defined
                    when designing the application or functionality. Broadly
                    speaking, the business rules dictate how the application
                    should react when a given scenario occurs. This includes
                    preventing users from doing things that will have a negative
                    impact on the business or that simply don't make sense.
                    Flaws in the logic can allow attackers to circumvent these
                    rules. For example, they might be able to complete a
                    transaction without going through the intended purchase
                    workflow. In other cases, broken or non-existent validation
                    of user-supplied data might allow users to make arbitrary
                    changes to transaction-critical values or submit nonsensical
                    input. By passing unexpected values into server-side logic,
                    an attacker can potentially induce the application to do
                    something that it isn't supposed to. Logic-based
                    vulnerabilities can be extremely diverse and are often
                    unique to the application and its specific functionality.
                    Identifying them often requires a certain amount of human
                    knowledge, such as an understanding of the business domain
                    or what goals an attacker might have in a given context.
                    This makes them difficult to detect using automated
                    vulnerability scanners. As a result, logic flaws are a great
                    target for bug bounty hunters and manual testers in general.

                        incorrect. For example, a developer might assume that a
                        user will always follow a certain sequence of steps when
                        using a feature, but in reality, users might not behave as
                        expected. This can lead to logic flaws if the application
                        doesn't handle these unexpected behaviors correctly.</p>

                        cause the application to behave in unexpected ways. For
                        example, an attacker might be able to manipulate a hidden
                        field in a form to change the price of an item in an

                        occur. For example, an application might allow a user to
                        perform an action that should be restricted, such as
